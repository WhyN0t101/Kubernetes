# Docker and Kubernetes for Resource Management

## Description
This project aims to create an easy-to-use distributed solution for any application using Docker and Kubernetes. The goal is to ensure this capability for large-scale solutions in any ecosystem.

In this context, an orchestration layer must be utilized to intelligently coordinate a set of servers and containers, keep track of the current state of all servers and associated resources, and maintain an inventory of all running containers.

Among the various solutions for orchestrating these resources, we will focus on Kubernetes within the scope of this project.

## Objective
The primary objective of this lab work is to design and implement an application (app) that serves as a frontend for managing resources provided through the Kubernetes orchestrator.

## Technology Stack
- **Docker**: For containerization of applications.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestration and management of containers.
- **C#**: The programming language used to develop the frontend application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a Kubernetes cluster)
- .NET SDK
